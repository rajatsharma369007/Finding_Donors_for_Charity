# Finding_Donors_for_Charity

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 or not. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations. Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit organisation better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.

## Dataset
I have used the census income dataset provided by UCI machine learning repository.

## Installation
* Pandas  
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* Numpy  
<code>conda install numpy</code>
* Scikit-learn  
<code>conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn</code>

## Accuracy
test score = 0.8718  
f score = 0.7545

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
